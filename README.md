# GoStack-Node-Challenge
This is resolution of GoStack Node Challenge.

In this proposed challenge there is an automated test (created by the company) and it will not pass in 2. However, if the code is carried out according to the test it will substitute for null the data that are not passed in the request. I did a data processing that I thought was best to maintain the highest data integrity.
